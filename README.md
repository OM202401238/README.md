Tetris Game (Console-based)
Project Description:

This is a simple console-based Tetris game written in C++. It simulates the classic Tetris experience with basic controls to move and rotate Tetrominoes. It includes functionality for clearing lines, scoring, pausing, and resuming the game.
Installation Instructions:

    Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the source code file.

    Open the project in any C++ IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or GCC for compiling).

    Compile the code:

        In GCC: g++ -o tetris tetris.cpp
